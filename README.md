## Motivation
To build a project in React using Functional Components and get to grips using Hooks.

## Outcome
Throughout the project useState and useEffect feature heavily. I was also introduced to hooks specific to the three.js ecosystem such as useThree, useFrame and useScroll. Components were created using functions.

## UI Features
<ul>
  <li>Autoscroll</li>
  <li>Z-axis tilt view</li>
  <li>Responsive 3D flex layout</li>
  <li>3D object emissive highlighting on hover + click/touch events </li>
</ul>
